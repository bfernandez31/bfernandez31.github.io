# Climate Data Dashboard

An interactive platform for visualizing complex climate datasets, making research accessible through intuitive charts, 3D globes, and animated timelines.

## Visualization Types

- **3D Globe Projection**: WebGL-powered Earth visualization showing temperature anomalies
- **Time Series Analysis**: Interactive charts with 50+ years of climate data
- **Heat Maps**: Regional temperature and precipitation patterns
- **Correlation Matrices**: Relationship between climate variables

## Technical Implementation

Built with D3.js for 2D visualizations and Three.js for 3D renders. Python backend processes massive datasets using NumPy and Pandas, served via FastAPI with WebSocket support for real-time updates.

## Impact

Used by 500+ researchers worldwide, the platform has facilitated several published papers and helped communicate climate science to policymakers and the public.
