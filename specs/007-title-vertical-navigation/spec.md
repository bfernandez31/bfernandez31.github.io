## Description

{"title":"Vertical Navigation Dots","description":"Goal: Create vertical navigation with dots\n\nNavigationDots.astro component\nPosition fixed right: 2rem\nOne dot per section (5 dots)\nActive state with scale animation\nClick to scroll to section\nDeliverable: src/components/ui/NavigationDots.astro"} IMPORTANT: never prompt me; you must do the full implementation, never run the full test suite, only impacted tests

## Implementation Notes

This feature is being implemented via quick-impl workflow, bypassing formal specification and planning phases.

**Quick-impl is suitable for**:
- Bug fixes (typos, minor logic corrections)
- UI tweaks (colors, spacing, text changes)
- Simple refactoring (renaming, file organization)
- Documentation updates

**For complex features**, use the full workflow: INBOX → SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD

## Implementation

Implementation will be done directly by Claude Code based on the description above.
