@[81817281:Benoît Fernandez] ✅ **Borders Removed from README Content**

I've removed all borders from the AboutReadme component for a clean file reading experience.

### Changes Made:
- **AboutReadme.astro**: Removed 3 border styles
  - Removed `border-bottom` from title (line 79)
  - Removed `border` from code block (line 139)
  - Removed `border-top` from footer (line 182)

The README section now displays without any borders, matching the clean markdown file reading aesthetic described in CLAUDE.md.

## Files Modified
- src/components/sections/AboutReadme.astro

## Summary
Removed all border styling from the AboutReadme component to achieve a clean, borderless markdown reading experience. This aligns with the project guidelines in CLAUDE.md which specify "About: README.md style (markdown formatting, displayed without header bar or border for clean file reading)". The component now displays content without visual borders on the title, code blocks, and footer sections.
