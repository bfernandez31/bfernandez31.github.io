## Implementation Notes

This feature is being implemented via quick-impl workflow, bypassing formal specification and planning phases.

**Quick-impl is suitable for**:
- Bug fixes (typos, minor logic corrections)
- UI tweaks (colors, spacing, text changes)
- Simple refactoring (renaming, file organization)
- Documentation updates

**For complex features**, use the full workflow: INBOX → SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD

## Implementation

Implementation will be done directly by Claude Code based on the description above.
