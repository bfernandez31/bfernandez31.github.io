## Description

{"title":"Cursor Trail Effect","description":"Goal: Add luminous trail to cursor\n\nExtension of CustomCursor\nCanvas for trail drawing\nFading particles\nLuminous violet color\n60fps with requestAnimationFrame\nDeliverable: src/scripts/cursor-trail.ts"} IMPORTANT: never prompt me; you must do the full implementation, never run the full test suite, only impacted tests

## Implementation Notes

This feature is being implemented via quick-impl workflow, bypassing formal specification and planning phases.

**Quick-impl is suitable for**:
- Bug fixes (typos, minor logic corrections)
- UI tweaks (colors, spacing, text changes)
- Simple refactoring (renaming, file organization)
- Documentation updates

**For complex features**, use the full workflow: INBOX → SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD

## Implementation

Implementation will be done directly by Claude Code based on the description above.
