## Description

{"title":"Custom Cursor Base","description":"Goal: Replace system cursor\n\nCustomCursor.astro component\nCircle following mouse\nMix-blend-mode: difference\nScale on hover (data-cursor=\"hover\")\nSmooth follow with GSAP quickTo\nDeliverable: src/components/ui/CustomCursor.astro"} IMPORTANT: never prompt me; you must do the full implementation, never run the full test suite, only impacted tests

## Implementation Notes

This feature is being implemented via quick-impl workflow, bypassing formal specification and planning phases.

**Quick-impl is suitable for**:
- Bug fixes (typos, minor logic corrections)
- UI tweaks (colors, spacing, text changes)
- Simple refactoring (renaming, file organization)
- Documentation updates

**For complex features**, use the full workflow: INBOX → SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD

## Implementation

Implementation will be done directly by Claude Code based on the description above.
